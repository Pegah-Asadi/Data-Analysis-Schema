# Data Analysis Schema

> A practical, repeatable framework for structured data analysis.

## "What's the plan?"

That's the question I've heard most from data analysts, myself included.

Every project has a unique goal, but successful analyses often follow the same backbone. This schema breaks down that backbone into 10 clear steps, from business framing to storytelling and documentation.
Some steps are strategic, others are technical. Some include code, others are just mindset.

Whether you're new to the role or just looking to sharpen your workflow, I hope this guide brings structure and clarity to your process.

👇 Let’s dive in.

## 🧠 0 | Frame the Business Question

Before any SQL or Python, clarify:

✅ What’s the business goal? (e.g. retention, cost reduction, partner ROI)  
📊 What metrics define success? (e.g. MAUs, cost per engaged member, NPS)  
⚠️ What are the constraints? (e.g. privacy laws, sample size, data freshness)

🛡️ Especially in regulated domains:

→ Use anonymized or pseudonymized data only  
→ Keep audit trails clean  
→ Only use the minimum necessary fields
